## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to find the starting point of a loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the starting node if a loop exists; otherwise, return null.

A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos denotes the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.

Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

### Example 1:

<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-9CeYMulT">

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1

**Output:** (value of the returned node is displayed): 2

**Expla﻿nation** : The tail of the linked list connects to the node at 1st index.

### Example 2:

<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-VIieMjlM">

**Input:** head -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4, pos = -1

**Output:** (value of the returned node is displayed): null

**Explanation:** No loop is present in the linked list.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 0 <= number of nodes in the cycle <= 10^5
- 0 <= ListNode.val <= 10^4
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked list

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
